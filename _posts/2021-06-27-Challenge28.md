# Description

**Challenge #T0048**

**Digital Duplicates**

**Author:** Jeff Echlin

**Framework Category:** Investigate

**Specialty Area:** Digital Forensics

**Work Role:** Law Enforcement/Counter Intelligence Forensics

**Task Description:** Create a forensically sound duplicate of the evidence (i.e., forensic image) that ensures the original evidence is not unintentionally modified, to use for data recovery and analysis processes. This includes, but is not limited to, hard drives, floppy diskettes, CDs, PDAs, mobile phones, GPS, and all tape formats.

**Scenario**

Recently Gary Thatcher our senior system administrator, came across a thumb drive attached to an employee's system. According to the employee, the thumb drive was attached without their consent and they are unsure of the origin of said drive. The drive was passed to Ione Leventis one of our security analysts. Ione has attached the drive to our sheep-dip system which in our case is the Security-Desk machine. However, Ione was called away on other matters and you are now entrusted with the task. According to current company policy the thumb drive must be inspected for any malicious agents that could threaten DAS Web's overall security. Your job is to create a forensically sound duplicate image of the thumb drive using dcfldd so it can be examined without the risk of inadvertently modifying potential evidence. SHA512 hashes should also be taken and compared between the original thumb drive which is already attached, but not mounted, to the system and the forensic image.

_**Additional Information**_

More details and objectives about this challenge will be introduced during the challenge meeting, which will start once you begin deploying the challenge.

You will be able to check your progress during this challenge using the check panel within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. The checks within the check panel report on the state of some or all of the required tasks within the challenge.

Once you have completed the requested tasks, you will need to document the methodology you used with as much detail and professionalism as necessary. This should be done on the documentation tab within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. Below the main documentation section be sure to include a tagged list of applications you used to complete the challenge.

Your username/password to access all virtual machines and services within the workspace will be the following...

**Username:** *playerone*

**Password:** *password123*

# dcfldd

## Example
```
dcfldd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/media/disk/test_image.dd hash=md5,sha1 hashlog=/media/disk/hashlog.txt

# Hash verification
dcfldd if=/dev/sdb1 vf=/media/disk/test_image.dd verifylog=/media/disk/verifylog.txt
```

## Challenge - Image /dev/sdb1

```
dcfldd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/forensicimages/forensicimage.dd hash=sha512 hashlog=/forensicimages/forensicimage.txt
```

1. Use dcfldd to make a forensically sound image and hash of the thumb drive 2. Store the image in /forensicimages/forensicimage.dd 3. Take a SHA512 hash of the thumb drive and compare it to the hash originally created with dcfldd.

```
dcfldd if=/dev/sdb1 vf=/forensicimages/forensicimage.dd verifylog=/forensicimages/forensicimage.txt
```

# Find the disk and change permissions to read only

## Change permissions on /dev/sdb to read only
```
sudo chomd 440 /dev/sdb

## Create /forensicimages folder

```
/forensicimages/forensicimage

## Image USB drive
```

# Summary

Tools:

	fdisk
	ls
	grep
	chmod
	mkdir
	dcfldd

Machines used:

	Security-Desk

I began the challenge and found the drive attached to the machine using "sudo fdisk -l".  This command listed the drives the system sees and the partitions.  

Next I checked the permissions on /dev/sdb, currently set to read/write, with the command ``ls -lha /dev | grep sd``.  

Then I change the permission to read-only on the disk using the command ``sudo chmod 440 /dev/sdb``.  

I checked for the existence of the forensicimages folder off root and was not found ``ls /``, issued the command ``sudo mkdir /forensicimages`` to create the folder.  

I then imaged the drive using the following command:
``sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sdb of=/forensicimages/forensicimage.dd hash=sha512 hashlog=/forensicimages/forenicimage.txt``

Verified the image with the following command:
``sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sdb vf=/forensicimages/forensicimage.dd verifylog=/forensicimages/forensicimage.txt``

I confirmed the match of the sha512 signature of the drive and image.
