# Description

**Challenge #T0297**

**Properly Prioritized Web Watching**

**Author:** Bailey Kasin

**Framework Category:** Protect and Defend

**Specialty Area:** Cybersecurity Defense Analysis

**Work Role:** Cyber Defense Analyst

**Task Description:** Identify applications and operating systems of a network device based on network traffic.

**Scenario**

Jan Cortes and Tim Clark have been dedicating too much time to support tickets for the website being broken. We can't make it work on every browser, so we need you to watch the traffic to our website so we know which web browsers to dedicate time to supporting.

**Additional Information**

More details and objectives about this challenge will be introduced during the challenge meeting, which will start once you begin deploying the challenge.

You will be able to check your progress during this challenge using the check panel within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. The checks within the check panel report on the state of some or all of the required tasks within the challenge.

Once you have completed the requested tasks, you will need to document the methodology you used with as much detail and professionalism as necessary. This should be done on the documentation tab within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. Below the main documentation section be sure to include a tagged list of applications you used to complete the challenge.

Your username/password to access all virtual machines and services within the workspace will be the following...
Username: playerone
Password: password123

The username/password used to access the Firewall's web interface within the workspace will be the following...
Username: admin
Password: password123

The web form used for this challenge accepts a limited number of entries.

# Summary

Applications used:

	Linux: su, nano, tail
	Windows: putty, notepad, FireFox

Installed putty on Workstation-Desk.  Launched a SSH session to 172.16.10.100.  Logged in with "playerone password123" and switch user to root "su".  Edited the configuration file for the Joomla site, ``nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/joomla.conf``.  Added ``LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %O \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined`` and changed CustomLog to remove "common" and changed it to "combined". Saved and exited nano.  Restarted apache service by ``apachectl restart``.

Checked log ``tail -f /var/log/apache2/joomla-access_log``, the ``tail -f`` will continully monitor the file for changes.  Saw the updates of the 4 IP's and their connections strings.  Copied this from the terminal to notepad.
