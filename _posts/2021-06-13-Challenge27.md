# Description

**Challenge #T0278**

**Executable Excavation**

**Author:** Bailey Kasin

**Framework Category:** Protect and Defend

**Specialty Area:** Incident Response

**Work Role:** Cyber Defense Incident Responder

**Task Description:** Collect intrusion artifacts (e.g., source code, malware, Trojans) and use discovered data to enable mitigation of potential cyber defense incidents within the enterprise. (T0278)

**Scenario**

Shawn O'Keefe had a strange executable that was found on his workstation. It has been isolated on Security Desktop, but we want you take a look at it to see if you can determine what it was doing.

_**Additional Information**_

More details and objectives about this challenge will be introduced during the challenge meeting, which will start once you begin deploying the challenge.

You will be able to check your progress during this challenge using the check panel within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. The checks within the check panel report on the state of some or all of the required tasks within the challenge.

Once you have completed the requested tasks, you will need to document the methodology you used with as much detail and professionalism as necessary. This should be done on the documentation tab within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. Below the main documentation section be sure to include a tagged list of applications you used to complete the challenge.

Your username/password to access all virtual machines and services within the workspace will be the following...

**Username:** *playerone*

**Password:** *password123*

The username/password used to access the Firewall's web interface within the workspace will be the following...

**Username:** *admin*

**Password:** *password123*

I downloaded the free version of .NET Reflector and loaded the payload.exe. Browsed the code and identified the time frame, IP, and port.

Timeframe: 7 minutes

Destination IP: 172.31.2.89

Destination Port: Hex: 0x38, Dec: 56

# Summary

Tools:

	Linux: strings, cat01
	Windows: WinSCP, .NET Reflector

Machines used:

	Workstation
	Security-Desk

Used strings to look at any text in the file.  Used cat to output the file to the screen.  I was able to identify the IP 172.31.2.89.

I then turned to the Windows workstation and transferred the payload.exe using WinSCP.  Download .NET Reflector a .NET decompiler.  I opened the payload.exe in .NET Refelector and took a look at the source code.  Found that the application runs for 7 minutes.  Found the function that launches the connection connects to 172.31.2.89 on port 0x38.  Converted the hex of the port 0x38 to decimal 56.  I filled in the form at 172.16.30.100 with the information from the decompiled payload.exe.

Submitted:

	Title: Submission #1
	Activity Type: reverseshell
	Mallicious IP Address: 172.31.2.89
	Malicious Port: 56
	Interval Payload Ran On: 7

The payload.exe looks to create a reverse shell and connect to the destination IP.  It is then used as a command and control to exfiltrate data from the machine.
