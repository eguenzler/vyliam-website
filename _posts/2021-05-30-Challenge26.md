# Description

**Challenge #T0028**<\n>
**Penetration Testing:** Bringing Passwords Up To Snuff

**Author:** Bailey Kasin

**Framework Category:** Protect and Defend

**Specialty Area:** Vulnerability Assessment and Management

**Work Role:** Vulnerability Assessment Analyst

**Task Description:** Conduct and/or support authorized penetration testing on enterprise network assets.

**Scenario**

We have reason to believe that some of our employees have weaker than should be acceptable passwords, so we want you to conduct authorized penetration testing against various company assets to determine which employees need to change their passwords.

_**Additional Information**_

More details and objectives about this challenge will be introduced during the challenge meeting, which will start once you begin deploying the challenge.

You will be able to check your progress during this challenge using the check panel within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. The checks within the check panel report on the state of some or all of the required tasks within the challenge.

Once you have completed the requested tasks, you will need to document the methodology you used with as much detail and professionalism as necessary. This should be done on the documentation tab within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. Below the main documentation section be sure to include a tagged list of applications you used to complete the challenge.

Your username/password to access all virtual machines and services within the workspace will be the following...

**Username:** *playerone*

**Password:** *password123*

The username/password used to access the Firewall's web interface within the workspace will be the following...

**Username:** *admin*

**Password:** *password123*
